# Laravel Clean Architecture

A modular, scalable, and maintainable Laravel project following the principles of **Clean Architecture**. This architecture separates concerns into layers: **Domain**, **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **Presentation**.

---

## üß± Project Structure

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/        # Use Cases, DTOs, Interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain/             # Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/     # Persistence, External services, Framework logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Presentations/      # Presentation layer (Controllers, Routes, ...etc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Providers/          # Service Providers
```

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

- **Domain**: Core business rules (pure PHP). No Laravel dependencies.
- **Application**: Use cases and service contracts. Also, framework-agnostic.
- **Infrastructure**: Implements Application interfaces using Laravel features (e.g., Eloquent, Queues).
- **Presentation**: Routes, Controllers, Middleware ‚Äî Laravel-specific input/output layer.
- **Providers**: Laravel service providers for bootstrapping and binding services.

## üîß Path Helper Functions

To simplify file handling and maintain structure across layers, we provide Laravel-style path helpers.

### üìÅ Located in:
```
app/Support/helpers.php
```

### üß© Available Helpers:
```php
infrastructure_path('Support/SomeFile.php');
domain_path('User/Entities/UserEntity.php');
application_path('User/UseCases/CreateUser.php');
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Make sure it's autoloaded in `composer.json`:

```json
"autoload": {
  "files": [
    "app/Support/helpers.php"
  ]
}
```

Then run:

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsoAfan/Laravel-clean-architecture.git
cd Laravel-clean-architecture
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

## üìö Commands

- `php artisan serve` ‚Äî Start the Laravel dev server
- `php artisan test` ‚Äî Run the test suite

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Domain Layer
| Component           | Suggested Path         | Layer  | Reason / Notes                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**        | `Domain/Entities/`     | Domain | Core business models (e.g., `UserEntity`).             |
| **ValueObjects**    | `Domain/ValueObjects/` | Domain | Encapsulate small, immutable concepts (e.g., `Email`). |
| **Domain Services** | `Domain/Services/`     | Domain | Logic that doesn‚Äôt belong to a single entity.          |
| **Domain Events**   | `Domain/Events/`       | Domain | Optional: pure business events.                        |
| **Aggregates**      | `Domain/Aggregates/`   | Domain | Optional: aggregate roots, if using DDD.               |

### Application Layer
| Component          | Suggested Path                                        | Layer       | Reason / Notes                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **UseCases**       | `Application/UseCases/`                               | Application | Core business logic, orchestrates flow.            |
| **DTOs**           | `Application/DTOs/`                                   | Application | Transfer data between layers.                      |

| **Services**       | `Application/Services/`                               | Application | Domain-related services reused across use cases.   |
| **Tasks**          | `Application/Tasks/`                                  | Application | Optional for reusable logic blocks.                |
| **Jobs** (generic) | `Application/Jobs/`                                   | Application | Only if they are framework-agnostic (pure PHP).    |


### Infrastructure Layer

| **Jobs (Queueable)**          | `Infrastructure/Jobs/`                     | Infrastructure   | Laravel jobs using queues, framework-dependent.         |

You may test each layer independently or mock dependencies using Laravel's testing helpers.
